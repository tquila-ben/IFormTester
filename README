== Welcome to IFormTester

IFormTester is a web-based application designed to work with IFormBuilder. It supports fetching XML Feed from IFormBuilder, as well as listening and receiving PostXML from IFormBuilder. In turn, IForm records can be tested by forwarding to another target URI.

== Getting Started

1. It is written in Ruby on Rails. You will need Ruby 1.9.2 and Rails 3.0.

2. Download the project from Github. Use bundler to set up your gems as usual.

3. It uses sqlite as database by default.


== Demo

An online demo is available for those who don't want the hard work of installing Ruby on Rails.
